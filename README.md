# Interactable ESP

Originally I just wanted to make this as a practice project emulating the effect of QoLChests, but I was suggested I try to make an ESP mod sooo- here we are.

Press F3 to enable / disable. Press F4 to open the GUI for customization (you can also just edit the config). Saved options are respected.

# Features

- Simple highlights (similar to QoL Chests) that can be color customized, and enabled / disabled at will
- Label name which will tell you the type of item as well as the distance to it. Optionally with an "Advanced" toggle which will show more info such as prices of chest / shops, as well as their contents, rarity- etc
- Bounding boxes can be drawn around the item for higher visibility, also gives that classic ESP look (can be disabled)
- You can enable / disable categories of items (EG: Chests, or Shops), as well as change the color associated (Applied to Highlight / Label and Bounding Box colors)
- In game GUI for configuration on the fly. Will respect your last chosen options as it utilizes the config file. Keybindings can be updated as well
